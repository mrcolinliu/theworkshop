Challenges are proposed by different business units, and the workshop team works closely with the unit to make it happen! Our most recent challenge? Collaborating with LF client Betabrand (an ecommerce store headquartered in San Francisco) who issued a challenge to any LF employee to design their next new travel product. The winner of the challenge will receive royalties from future sales (and by doing so, we are empowering internal entrepreneurs!).",

      "title": "KNIQUE Popup",
      "description": "The LF Sweaters team had excess luxury yarn and wanted to salvage it. They decided to trial the concept of ‘upcycling’ which led to the creation of a beautifully designed, 17-piece collection. At that point the business wanted to know: would the collection sell, and did the concept behind the brand (sustainable luxury fashion) present a viable business opportunity worth exploring? The team reached out to us at the wørkshop, to connect with the right people and expertise to put this experiment into motion. Seven teams came together (LF Sweater Vertical, Corporate Communications, Creative & Design, Digital, the wørkshop, GTS and LF Beauty) to test, experiment and collaborate around the brand story, e-commerce store and Pop-Up Shop that was opened in The HIVE. Want to find out how the experiment fared? You can read more here: https://onefamily.lfapps.net/article/20378",
