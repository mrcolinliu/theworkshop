Introducing SLACK to our team

This was a project I did within the communications department for an organisation based in Hong Kong.  A small project, and it was decided no CMS or Framework was required due the the simple nature of the work.

A basic website to encourage staff to use more of SLACK for communications.

Making the interface as fun and interesting as possible with the use of simple CSS, HTML and some added JavaScript magic
